    <p>At the end of the French and Indian war, there was the Treaty of Paris of 1763. In which Britain gained control of Florida and most French territory going up to the Mississippi river and Canada. It was a great victory for Britain and the colonists and they celebrated accordingly. Nobody thought in around 20 years the colonists would be fighting in a war against Great Britain</p>

First was the Proclamation of 1763, which stopped any colonists from going west of the Appalachian Mountains. This was a smart move by Britain because it kept colonists out of Native American lands, which prevented another conflict between the colonists and Native Americans. The colonists were outraged. They thought they should be able to settle on the land that they just fought for. This was one of the many ingredients that made the american revolution. 

One reason the British did not want war to break out in the frontier again is they were in debt. I'll give you guess for what they did. If you guessed tax the colonies, you're correct. First there was the Sugar Act of 1764. This put a tax on imported goods. It was meant to make the colonists only buy British goods. The opposite happened. The colonists, angry because they were paying the colonies taxes and the kings,  protested through the colonies. They also boycotted British goods, so Britain's economy and merchants would suffer.<br><br>

Then, there was the Stamp Act of 1765. This act put a tax on paper goods. Everything from playing cards to newspapers was taxed. It was meant to pay for the 10,000 troops that stopped settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains.  The actual cost of the tax was not too big--but not having a say in parliament ,which voted for the stamp act, dismayed the colonist. So, they used the slogan, “ No taxation without representation.”  Dismayed by the new law, the colonists made and hatched a plan. The plan was to first burn a effigy of the tax collector,  then the storm their house, and finally tar and feather them. The goal of this was for the tax collectors to be really scared so they wouldn't enforce the taxes. They plan worked accordingly. So the colonists did not have to pay the tax at all after all. <br><br>

The next one was the Quartering Act of 1765. It meant that the colonists must house and feed the British soldiers in their homes. This sparked even more protest. The ingredients of the american revolution were growing. In 1766, the eighteenth of March, The parliament passed the Declaratory Act. This repealed the Stamp Act, but parliament declared that they still had the right to tax the colonies. During this time, the Sugar Act was repealed. The colonists had a big celebration about the repeal of the Stamp Act. In New York, they even built a statue of King George III. They also ended the boycott and the British economy and merchants were happy to have the Americans buying their goods. Well. It could of ended here, but, of course it didn't. King George still thought that God gave kings and queens the divine right to rule, and it was the citizens of the kingdoms job to obey. <br><br>

 So in late June of 1767, there was the Townshend Revenue Act, also known as the Townshend Duties. Acording to https://www.bl.uk/the-american-revolution/articles/american-revolution-timeline, this act put “duties on tea, glass, lead, paper and paint to help pay for the administration of the colonies, named after Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer.” It sparked more protest in the colonies and the boycott started again. The argument picked up where it started and the slogan “No taxation without representation.” was used again. In 1768, the first British troops arrived in Boston, to quell the rebellious feeling.<br><br>

Then in 1770, March, there was the Boston Massacre (from the patriots point of view) or The Incident on King Street (from the British perspective). The incident occurred on March 5, 1770. That night, on King Street, private Hugh White was standing guard at the custom house on that street. A young wig maker's apprentice named Edward Garrick called out to the British officer, Captain-Lieutenant John Goldfinch, that Goldfinch had not paid a bill due to Garrick's master. Goldfinch did not respond. White told Garrick to pay more respect to the officer and then he and Garrick exchanged a few insults. , White left his post and bashed Garrick with the but of his musket. His friend spread the news. Then, as the mob grew, the church bells rang, which brought more people into the rumble. Captain Thomas Preston got news by a runner and and sent a non-commissioned officer and six privates of the 29th Regiment of Foot, with fixed bayonets, to relieve White. Then, Crispus Attucks, the leader of the mob, threw an object at Private Hugh Montgomery, a soldier of the 29th Regiment of Foot. Sources say Private Montgomery responded by saying “Damn you, fire.” <br>  <br>  <img width="300px" src="https://www.varsitytutors.com/images/earlyamerica/massacre1.jpg" /><br><br>

Even without orders from a commander, the soldiers let out a series of shots into the crowd. 11 people were shot and there was a silence for a few a few seconds to 2 minutes. The people that perished immediately were ropemaker Samuel Gray, mariner James Caldwell, and Crispus Attucks. According to Wikipedia, “Samuel Maverick, an apprentice ivory turner of seventeen, was struck by a ricocheting musket ball at the back of the crowd, and died a few hours later. An Irish immigrant, Patrick Carr, died two weeks later.” In all, 5 people died. Captain Prescott and the soldiers were arrested and charged with  manslaughter and two were found guilty and had a “M” branded on their hand. They were sent to England. Paul Revere made powerful propaganda out of it and it won many pepole to the patriots side.The parliament and King George, shocked by this news, immediately repealed the Townshend Act on April 12 to try to smooth relationships with the colonists.  <br><br>

Following all of this there was the Tea Act of 1773. It was not really a tax though. It was created to help the East Indies Tea Company. It kept the tax on tea from the repealed Townshend Act and  made it so any tea from the company would not be taxed by the act. They hoped it would encourage the colonists to buy the British tea. The opposite happened.  The patriots saw this as an indirect tax because it was meant to use their money to fill British pockets. So they did a protest against this one. It was not tarring and feathering but it was destruction of property. It was called the Boston Tea Party! <br><br>

The patriots,angry about the taxes, decided to go English, with a good ol fashioned tea party. But this was different type of party. Here is what happened. There were ships in the harbor which had British tea in them, but the patriots would not allow them to unload the tea. To add to this, the British threatened to unload the teathrough force. So, the patriots attempted to look like Mohawk Native Americans, and boarded the ships. The plan worked and all the tea was dumped overboard. After checking to see if some people took some tea (some did), the patriots left the ships before the redcoats could stop them.In total they dumped 340 chests of tea in the ocean. This was obviously not going to be tolerated by the British. ”<br><br>  <img width="300px" src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z9SYPXW1L.jpg" /><br><br>


The British responded with a series of acts. For example, there was the The Intolerable Acts of 1774. There was the Quebec Act which gave part of Maine, which was in Massachusetts, to Quebec. The Administration of Justice Act made it so British authorities could have their trials where they wanted. The Quartering Act of 1774 made it so British soldiers had to be fed and cared for at the colonists houses. The Massachusetts Government Act Gave the royal governor more power and made it so the charter of Massachusetts had to be handed in, and finally the Boston Port Act which closed the Boston Port. All of this until all the tea was paid for. All of these acts set the stage for war. All you need for a war is battles. The one which happened first was the battle of Lexington and Concord.<br><br>

 It’s  April 18, 1775 and Samuel Adams and John Hancock are at Lexington and patriot weapons and gunpowder are in Concord. General Gage, the commander of British forces in Boston, knows this and under pressure from London to seize the weapons. There are two ways he can do this. The first is go through the Boston Neck, by land. The second is to go across the water, by sea. Gage selects the second option, going by sea. The scene is set for the battles of Lexington and Concord. The British troops who are going to go across the harbor, cross a couple hours late. Paul Revere and  William Dawes are summoned by Dr. Warren to alert the people of Lexington and Concord.  William Dawes will go by land across the Boston neck and Revere by sea. On his way to get to the shore, Revere tells a friend to light two lanterns in the church. And yes, this is one if by land, two if by sea.  William Dawes makes it through the neck and starts going towards Concord and Revere has successfully crossed by sea. Now, I know what you are thinking the message was  “The british are coming!”, but sadly, you’re wrong. Many people consider themselves British due to being part of the British empire and it would be offensive to them. So they said ”The regulars(British soldiers), are coming”. Anyway, like I said, the British still hadn’t crossed the harbor. But they wouldsoon and they started the march on Lexingon.
<br><br>
You will be happy to know that  Samuel Adams and John Hancock both got away from the British, after some bickering,  got away from the British. The riders were joined by Samuel Prescott when they reached Lexington. Unfortunately for the riders they got caught by the a British patrol. Revere got captured, Dawes fell off his horse and ran towards Concord and Prescot made it through. Revere, after being interrogated, was let go, but the British took his horse. But there was some fighting between 80 Lexington militiamen and the British army. Acording to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord#Lexington  “A British officer (probably Pitcairn, but accounts are uncertain, as it may also have been Lieutenant William Sutherland) then rode forward, waving his sword, and called out for the assembled militia to disperse, and  may also have ordered them to "lay down your arms, you damned rebels!"[50] <br><br> 

Captain Parker told his men instead to disperse and go home, but, because of the confusion, the yelling all around, and due to the raspiness of Parker's tubercular voice, some did not hear him, some left very slowly, and none laid down their arms. Both Parker and Pitcairn ordered their men to hold fire, but a shot was fired from an unknown source.” Then, the British army lost all of their discipline and started firing and charged with bayonets without orders. Only after some loud yelling by Picton and the drummers beating cease fire did the soldiers stop. 7 minutemen died and a british horse got shot and a sargent. Neither were that serious wounds. They continued to march on Concord. <br><br>

The patriots were alerted at Concord and retreated to the hills behind. The British entered the town and found mostly nothing. The patriots hid everything pretty well. One hiding technique that was used is that the patriots would tell the British they could look around the house except one room which had a sick woman. The British, being gentleman, didn’t look in that room and found nothing. In truth, the room was full of muskets. They did find a wagon used to pull weapons and burned it. The patriots, whose numbers were growing, thought the British were burning the town and started to march on the town. They were ordered not to fire except when fired opened. There was a river in between the town and the patriots and the British tried to tear it up but failed. The small group of British soldiers fired upon the patriots which in turn fired upon them. The British skillfully retreated, but they didn’t know there was tons of patriots on the way back. They started firing on the British and the British skillful retreat became a rout. <br><br> <img width="300px" src="http://www.britishbattles.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Map-Concord-and-lexington.jpg"><br><br>

Percy came with reinforcements and assumed command and had the British rest at Lexington. Percy had his army come to Lexington on a route that would not be usable to escape . He didn’t know this, but still brought the British back to Charleston and then by boat across the harbor. Along the way, there was heavy fighting after Meriam's Corner. Some of the fighting was in houses.The British had more than 200 hundred  injured and almost 100 killed. The colonists injuries were less than one fourth of the British wounded and killed. The British now found themselves trapped in boston with 15,000 Minutemen sieging them. Both sides used this event  for propaganda. After all that had happened, you had the American Revolution! </p>
